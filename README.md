# Covid19Dataset_Regression
The Covid-19 pandemic has significantly impacted global health systems, prompting extensive research into its effects and the factors influencing disease outcomes. This report outlines the methodology and findings of a supervised learning project aimed at predicting new Covid-19-related deaths in Malaysia using various features derived from Covid-19 datasets. The objective is to utilize machine learning techniques to analyze the relationships between different variables and their impact on mortality rates during the pandemic. The datasets utilized for this analysis, including “cases_malaysia.csv”, “deaths_malaysia.csv”, “icu.csv”, and “pkrc.csv”, sourced from the Malaysian Ministry of Health's public GitHub repository. The focus is on predicting the “deaths_new” variable from the deaths_malaysia.csv dataset, leveraging features from the other three datasets. 
The analysis will specifically cover data from June 1, 2021, to January 1, 2022, spanning 6 months.
